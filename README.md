# Transmission Model for Salmonella Heidelberg in Broilers using Ordinary Differential Equations

## Description

As part of the development of a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model of third-generation cephalosporins (3GC)-resistant Salmonella Heidelberg, a compartmental (SEIR) model was developed for S.â€¯Heidelberg transmission within a typical Canadian commercial broiler chicken flock. The model was constructed to estimate the within-flock prevalence and the bacterial concentration in the barn environment at pre-harvest, and to assess the effect of selected control measures.
